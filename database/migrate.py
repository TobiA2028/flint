Database Migration Script for Flint Spark Civic Engagement App

This script helps set up and populate the Supabase database with initial data.
It can be run to initialize a fresh database or reset existing data.

Usage:
    python migrate.py --setup    # Run schema + functions + seed data
    python migrate.py --seed     # Run seed data only
    python migrate.py --reset    # Reset and re-populate all data

Prerequisites:
    1. Create a Supabase project
    2. Set SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY in your .env file
    3. Install requirements: pip install supabase python-dotenv
